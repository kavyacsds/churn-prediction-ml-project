# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. Customer churn refers to customers who stop using a company’s service. The goal of this project is to identify such customers in advance so that businesses can take preventive actions to improve retention.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze customer data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Build machine learning models to predict churn
* Evaluate model performance using classification metrics
* Identify important features influencing churn
* Provide business insights for reducing churn

---

## 🗂 Dataset

The dataset contains customer-related information such as:

* Demographic details
* Service usage details
* Account and billing information
* Target variable: **Churn (0 = No, 1 = Yes)**

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib & Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

---

## 🔍 Steps Performed

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**

   * Loaded dataset into pandas DataFrame
   * Handled missing values
   * Converted categorical variables into numerical form

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Analyzed churn distribution
   * Visualized relationships between features and churn
   * Identified important trends

3. **Feature Engineering**

   * Selected relevant features
   * Scaled numerical features

4. **Model Building**

   * Implemented Logistic Regression
   * Implemented Random Forest Classifier

5. **Model Evaluation**

   * Used confusion matrix
   * Used classification report (precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy)

6. **Feature Importance Analysis**

   * Extracted important features from Random Forest
   * Ranked top contributing features

---

## 📈 Results

* Built predictive models to classify churn customers
* Random Forest performed better than Logistic Regression
* Identified key features that influence churn

---

## 💡 Business Impact

* Helps companies identify customers likely to churn
* Enables targeted marketing and retention strategies
* Reduces customer acquisition cost
* Improves customer satisfaction

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Handle class imbalance using SMOTE
* Perform hyperparameter tuning
* Try additional models (XGBoost, SVM)
* Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit
